"""The stop controls are fired at a synthetic run and judged by what they stop (#703).

`scripts/mitigation_drill.py` is offline and in-process: the real session turn
queue and the real cancel route handler, a real `WorkerPool` over a scratch
queue. What these tests pin is the drill's honesty — a control that does
nothing fails it, and a pause is never reported as an in-flight stop.
