"""eval/run_eval.py must say which corpus it scored, and refuse an empty one.

The blind spot this pins: with `RECALL_GRAPH_RERANK = False` the graph never
reorders documents, and the document leg queries the qmd daemon at an absolute
external URL. So a run against an entirely empty fact tree and an empty graph
store produces a well-formed record with `errors: 0` whose mrr_doc, ndcg10,
doc_hit_rate and every per-category mrr_doc are IDENTICAL to a real run. Only
entity_hit_rate, entity_recall_avg and fact_entity_recall_avg collapse — three
numbers nobody reads first. An empty corpus was therefore indistinguishable
from a healthy one in the headline metrics.

Everything here goes through subprocess rather than importing the module:
`app.paths` reads LLOYD_FACTS_ROOT / LLOYD_KG_DB at IMPORT time, so an
in-process test would have to win a race with the import, and the CLI contract
(exit code, message, flag) is the thing that actually protects the operator.
