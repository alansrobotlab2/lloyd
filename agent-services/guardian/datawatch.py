"""Data-root tripwire: `~/lloyd-data` is watched the way the vault is.

Lloyd's runtime data — transcripts, `workers.db`, `usage.db`, the knowledge
graph, the logs — lived inside the code tree until 2026-09-22, when a pytest
fixture teardown deleted `~/lloyd` and all of it with the code. It moved to
`~/lloyd-data` (`architecture/data-home.md`), out of reach of anything aimed at
the tree. This is the tick-by-tick half of guarding it; the hourly read-only
btrfs snapshots are the other.

Same thresholds and latch as `vaultwatch` (it reuses `measure`/`evaluate`),
plus the two things specific to the data root:

* the root must carry `.lloyd-data-root`. `app.paths` refuses to start
  production without it, so a missing marker is either a deletion or a swap;
* a watch that has never seen the root is not armed. A machine that has not
  been cut over yet has no data root to lose, and a tripwire that fires on day
  one teaches everyone to clear it without reading it.

A trip pauses the worker pool and halts promotions (there is no sync to stop),
writes `data-tripped.json`, and alerts critical. `snapshot-data.sh` refuses
while the marker exists, so a gutted root never becomes the newest snapshot.

`stray_in_tree` is the drift check: a runtime name reappearing inside
`~/lloyd` means some writer still resolves its path off the code tree.
